# ETHICS.md

In my web scraping project, I prioritized adherence to ethical practices by ensuring that the data collection methods strictly followed the target website's terms of service. Below are the key ethical considerations and measures taken to ensure responsible scraping:

## Compliance with Website Guidelines

Before initiating any data collection, I carefully reviewed the target website's terms of service. This proactive approach ensured that my scraping activities were fully aligned with the website’s policies, reducing potential legal or ethical risks.

## Checking Site Permissions

An important step in our process was inspecting the website's `robots.txt` file. This file outlines the permissible areas for scraping, and by adhering to its rules, we avoided accessing restricted content or violating any guidelines. This practice is essential for responsible and lawful web scraping.

## Incorporating Request Delays

Although the scraping operation targeted a single page, I implemented intentional delay intervals using `time.sleep()`. These delays helped reduce the number of rapid consecutive requests to the server, thereby preventing any potential strain on the website’s resources and ensuring a minimal impact on its performance. This technique preserves server integrity and contributes to a better user experience for others.

## Commitment to Responsible Data Collection

The data collected through this project is for **educational purposes only** and complies with fair use principles. I strictly focused on gathering publicly available information while fully respecting the terms of service. This reinforces my dedication to ethical data collection and responsible web scraping.
